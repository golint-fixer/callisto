callisto
========

Yet another Solar System simulator, written by Valerian Saliou in Go.

**Disclaimer: the purpose of this simulator isnt to be realistic. It was a nice way to teach myself OpenGL basics with complex 3D objects (spheres), and simple transforms. The code is shared as an example basis for those learning OpenGL; as I did.**

## Dependencies

 * **Go** (install it via: `brew install golang`)

## Install
